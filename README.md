This is a research I worked on in 2019/2020 at Politecnico of Tourin.
In this work, we use several Machine Learning models to identify true pulsar stars, while minimizing the false positive rate. 
We assess the models's performances among many different ML models and see which is the best one for detecting real pulsars.

Here's an extract of the final best results:
